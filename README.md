# Finite-State Machine in C#
This program, developed in C#, allows you to simulate any Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) with any number of states and any number of characters / symbols in the language.
It also allows you to input a string to test it with your defined DFA, and gives output accordingly.

## Functionality & Features
1. No hard-coded limit of states and characters/symbols of the language.

2. User-friendly state transition table. Enter the state transitions as you'd normally enter if you were drawing state transition table on paper.

3. Set one or multiple final states.

4. Enter an input string to test it according to your given DFA. The input string can be as long as you desire.

5. If enabled, the program also shows you step-by-step state transition for every character in your input string.

## Technical Details
32-bit Windows Form Application. Works on Windows 7 and later.

Developed in Visual Studio 2013 for the class of subject 'Theory of Automata'.
